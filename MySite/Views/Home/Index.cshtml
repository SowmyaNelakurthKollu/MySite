                My name is <span class="namehigh">Sowmya Nelakurthi</span> and I am a technology enthusiast. I was excited because I got a job in the career field that I wanted! Everything is great now. This website is an effort that I designed on my own to write down all the self-tested methods and programming challenges, providing working solutions and real-time consultancy to anyone—especially youngsters—who are stuck with software and technology-related doubts. I know there is more to say; we all have our own drives and passions. You'll see it on this website itself—it's quite a huge part of who I am.
